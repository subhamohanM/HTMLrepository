<p>Man is the most wonderful creation of God. Almighty equipped man with the power of thinking and reasoning and this is what distinguishes him from the other living beings. Man does not just exist but lives to his fullest by making use of various resources available on earth.

    Human species have evolved from monkeys and apes. Man has evolved immensely since the ancient age. The early man had a huge built, ate raw food, lived in caves and wore bare minimal clothing made of leaves and animal skin. After inventing fire man began roasting animals and vegetables before eating. A number of inventions were made with time. Man moved out of the caves and built houses to live in. Soon villages were formed and then towns and cities came into being. Means of transport also evolved and so did various other things. So, basically with the evolution of man, a number of things were invented and they evolved over the time too.</p>
